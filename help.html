		<h1>GETTING STARTED</h1>
        Managing your City requires that you carefully balance the production of your goods and products. If you're having problems, this section should help! There are several important aspects to remember: Building, Manufacturing, Collecting, and Upgrading.

		<dl>
			<dt class="">Building</dt>
			<dd style="display: none;">
			    <p>A city needs to grow, and the best way to help yours grow is to construct new buildings. All sorts of houses, businesses, and civic buildings are available in the Marketplace, ready to be added to your city.</p>
			    <p>Most buildings can be purchased with coins, but you'll need Business Permits to build new businesses. Business Permits can be earned by mastering existing businesses and on some City Hall upgrades.</p>
          	</dd>
			<dt class="">Manufacturing</dt>
			<dd style="display: none;">
				<p>Order Goods from your Train Depot by tapping on it and dragging the package size of Goods that you want into an available slot. Once the unloading timer finishes, the Goods will be delivered to the loading docks in your Train Depot. Tap on the deliveries to move them to your warehouse, where they can be used to directly fill some orders from businesses.</p>
				<p>Most orders from businesses require an assortment of Products. These can be made in your factories, using a combination of Goods and other Products. You can tap on the 'Make' button in an order to go to the factory where it's made and see what you need to make it.</p>
				<p>Products you can make are grouped into one of six industries: Dining, Shopping, Housing, Entertainment, Services, and Technology. Your city will eventually have factories for each industry where you can make a variety of fun items for your city's businesses!</p>
            </dd>
			<dt class="">Collecting</dt>
			<dd style="display: none;">
                <p>Collect all sorts of items from around your city to help it grow. Your Train Depot receives shipments of Goods, and your factories make all sorts of neat Products to help you fill orders from businesses. You can collect these items simply by tapping on them on the board.</p>
                <p>You also have a chance to collect special items from your city's citizens, by tapping on them to chat as they walk around your city. Some of these special items are used to expand your city's warehouse, allowing you to store more items. Others are used to unlock new land expansions, so you can keep making your city larger. You can also collect items that allow you to unlock new slots in high-rises, where you can move mastered businesses and houses to free up more space in your city.</p>
				<p>As your city expands, you also collect coins from your City Hall. The more 5-star businesses your city has, the more coins you can collect each day!</p>
            </dd>
            <dt class="">Upgrading</dt>
			<dd style="display: none;">
				<p>Add more houses and civic buildings to increase your city's Population. Add more businesses and help them become 5-Star establishments to increase your Mastery Star total. Once you have enough Population and Mastery Stars, you can upgrade your City Hall and unlock all sorts of great, new buildings to add to your city!</p>
                <p>Goals can involve collecting ingredients, cooking, learning recipes, and buying items in the Market.</p>
			</dd>
                                               
           <p>That should be enough to get you started and run a great city!</p>

         <h1>ADDITIONAL FEATURES</h1>
		<dl>
            <dt class="">Coins, EXP, and Gems</dt>
			<dd style="display: none;"> 
                <p>Earn Coins by filling orders from businesses, tapping on citizens to see what they have to say, and collecting from your City Hall. Coins are used to purchase most new buildings, and to upgrade buildings and expand your city.</p>
                <p>Buy Gems by tapping the Add Gems button.</p>
			</dd>
            <dt class="">Expanding Your City</dt>
			<dd style="display: none;"> 
                <p>Expand your city by tapping on the signs in areas adjacent to your existing city.</p>
                <p>Expanding costs Coins and Parts.</p>
                <p>You can get Parts by tapping on citizens.</p>
			</dd>         
                      
        </dl>
		<h1>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>
		<dl>
			<dt class="expanded">Why can't I build more businesses?</dt>
			<dd style="">
				<p>Building new businesses requires additional Business Permits. A Business Permit typically lets you build any unlocked business from a particular industry so that you can customize the look of your city. To earn more Business Permits, master existing businesses and keep upgrading your City Hall.</p>
			</dd>
			<dt class="">How Can I Get More Gems?</dt>
			<dd style="display: none;">
				You can get more Gems by tapping the Add button next to the Gems icon at the top of the screen. Once you tap this Add button, you will be able to select from several Gem offers available for purchase.
			</dd>
			<dt class="">How do I get parts to upgrade my buildings? What about expansion parts?</dt>
			<dd style="display: none;">
               Tap on citizens with speech bubbles to hear what they have to say about how you're doing as Mayor. They may drop some coins or even a part for you as well!
			</dd>
			<dt class="">It says my Storage is full - what now?</dt>
			<dd style="display: none;">
               You can upgrade the capacity of your Storage so you can store more items!
               <p>- Tap on the Warehouses near the Train Depot.</p>
               <p>- Use the necessary Parts to increase your storage capacity.</p>
			</dd>
            <dt class="">How do I move buildings?</dt>
			<dd style="display: none;">
               <p>You can tap and hold on a building already in your city. You can then drag the building to a new position and tap the green check mark when it's in a location that you're happy with. Once you're done moving buildings around, tap on the red X button in the Market tray to close it and exit Edit Mode.</p>

			</dd>
			<dt class="">How do I put buildings in Storage? How do I get them back out again?</dt>
			<dd style="display: none;">
				<p>Tap on the Market to enter Edit Mode. Tap the building you wish to remove. If it can be stored, tap on the box icon that appears below the building. This moves it into your Storage. Some buildings, like factories, City Hall, and businesses with active orders cannot be stored.</p>
				<p>Please note that a stored building does not contribute to the operation of your city. For example, a house that has been stored no longer provides population until it is returned to the board.</p>
				<p>To find a building in your Storage, tap the Market button and then locate the building in the Storage tab (the tab icon looks like an open box). You do not need to buy it again - just tap on the item to return it to your city.</p>
            </dd>
           <dt class="">How Do I Sell Items?</dt>
           <dd style="display: none;">
           <p>If you would like to sell a building, tap and hold the building you wish to sell. If it is eligible to be sold, you will see a Sell button next to the item. Be careful before you decide to sell anything though; you may have to work hard to get it again, and some rewards you won't be able to earn a second time. </p>
